1. Login and Selection

The timetable coordinator logs in to the system.

After login, the coordinator selects one of two options: School or College.

For SCHOOL:

The user should enter the details of all teachers in the school so that teachers can be directly selected while allotting subjects.

For generating the timetable for any class:

The user should enter the subjects for that particular class.

For each subject, the user should assign teachers from the teacher table entered previously.

The user should enter the number of divisions for each class (for example, 10A, 10B), ensuring that subjects for each division of any class remain the same.

When generating a timetable for any class, the system should generate timetables for all divisions of that class.

Teachers for each subject for each division must be allotted separately by the user.

The user should enter the number of periods of each lecture per week to maintain a proper distribution of lectures.

The user should enter the number of periods per class because:

For KG sections, school time and periods are fewer.

For higher classes, they are greater.

The system should also ask:

When to allot short breaks and lunch breaks.

The number of periods per day for each day from Monday to Saturday.

If the user wants any lecture of a particular subject to be conducted twice in a day, the system should allow the user to select that subject or choose “none” as default.

Ensure that there is a fixed classroom allotted to each standard, meaning the class remains in the same room throughout the day.

The final output will be a timetable for each division of each class, ensuring all timetable constraints are satisfied.

For COLLEGE:

After selecting College, the user must enter the department name and assign it a primary key in the database.

The user should enter room numbers for all classrooms, labs, and tutorial rooms available in the department.

The user should enter teacher details in the department so that teachers can be directly selected while allotting lectures, labs, and tutorials.

The user should then select the academic year (e.g., 1st Year, 2nd Year, or 3rd Year).

Ensure that particular classrooms and labs are allotted to the entire department, meaning:

Any division from that department can be allotted any lab or classroom.

Try to allot lectures for each division on the same floor.

If constraints occur, the division can be shifted to another floor.

Example: D301 means D-building, 3rd floor, classroom number 1.

Ensure that there are no unnecessary gaps between lectures for both teachers and students.

After selecting the year, the user should:

Enter course subjects, lab subjects, and tutorial subjects.

Enter the number of divisions for that year.

The user should then assign teachers to each lecture, lab, and tutorial for every division by selecting from the teacher database.

Ensure that each subject has only one lab per day, and the duration of each lab is two consecutive lecture slots (e.g., two hours if one lecture = one hour).

The total college time may not be perfectly consistent, but should be balanced, allowing up to 1–2 hours difference between divisions.

Ensure that students’ time is utilized effectively and not wasted, giving them more time for self-study.

For example, if there are two divisions — 10A and 10B — their teachers and subjects should be the same, and there must be no conflicts between them.

Additional College Rules for Batch Handling

If a class has three batches (for example, Division A → A1, A2, A3):

If A1 is in the lab, then A2 and A3 should not remain free.

The system must ensure that A2 and A3 have other subjects, labs, or tutorials scheduled during that time.

In the timetable, batch name should be clearly mentioned — for example:

TY A1 or FY B2 (Division + Batch).

During lab or tutorial hours, the timetable should display the schedule of all three batches together under the same division, so it’s easy to see which batch has which activity.

The system must generate a separate timetable for every division (e.g., Division A, Division B, etc.), clearly showing all batch allocations within each division’s timetable.
