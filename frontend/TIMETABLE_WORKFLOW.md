# 🎓 Smart Timetable Generator - Complete Workflow Guide

## 📋 Overview

This Smart Timetable Generator follows the complete workflow as per your flowchart, implementing both **School Mode** and **College Mode** with intelligent constraint satisfaction and optimization algorithms.

## 🧩 Complete Application Flow

### 🚀 **Phase 1: Initial Setup**
1. **User Registration/Login** → Coordinator logs into the system
2. **Mode Selection** → Choose between School or College mode
3. **Basic Configuration** → Configure periods, breaks, and constraints
4. **Data Entry** → Enter teachers, subjects, classes, and rooms

### 🏫 **Phase 2A: School Mode Workflow**
1. **Teacher Details Entry** → Add all teachers with subjects and availability
2. **Subject Configuration** → Define subjects for each class (1st-10th)
3. **Teacher-Subject Assignment** → Assign teachers to subjects
4. **Division Setup** → Configure divisions per class (e.g., 10A, 10B)
5. **Period Configuration** → Set periods per week and day
6. **Break Settings** → Configure short break and lunch timings
7. **Room Assignment** → Fixed classroom per standard
8. **Generation Process** → Phase 1 (Constraints) + Phase 2 (Optimization)

### 🎓 **Phase 2B: College Mode Workflow**
1. **Department Setup** → Create departments with unique IDs
2. **Room & Lab Configuration** → Add classrooms, labs, tutorials
3. **Teacher Management** → Add teachers with expertise
4. **Year Selection** → Choose academic year (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
5. **Subject Types** → Configure lectures, labs, tutorials
6. **Division Setup** → Set number of divisions per year
7. **Advanced Constraints** → Floor allocation, lab sessions
8. **Generation Process** → Enhanced algorithms for complex scheduling
